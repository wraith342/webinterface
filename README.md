# JS-WebInterface
 A small webinterface i made just for turning my computer off remotely from the couch

# Install
 type "npm i" into the console and after that just start the "start.vbs"

# Infos
 Its nothing special, its just a express json api with an webserver that requests the api. As i remember i made the gui with electron.
